# Technical Standards

## Architecture Overview
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Streamlit-based web interface
- Multiple social media publishing endpoints
- AI-powered content generation and evaluation
- Image generation and manipulation capabilities

## Code Organization
- All core functionality in `modules/` directory
- Separate modules for each social platform
- Utility functions in dedicated modules
- Clear separation of UI and business logic
- Test files prefixed with `test_`

## Development Standards
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Type hints for function parameters
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Error handling with appropriate logging
- Environment variable management with dotenv

## API Integration
- Secure credential management
- Rate limiting compliance
- Proper error handling
- Response validation
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Manual UI testing procedures
- Error scenario coverage
- Performance benchmarking

## Security Standards
- No hardcoded credentials
- Environment variable protection
- API key rotation procedures
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure file handling practices

## Performance Guidelines
- Caching for expensive operations
- Efficient image processing
- Optimized API calls
- Resource usage monitoring
- Response time optimization
