I want to create a new process utilizing the tools we have for AI evaluations.

On step 2, I want to give the ability to talk about AI's recommendation and have it reconsider the evaluation.

This is because we often get very breaking news, which can trigger "inplausable" concerns about the facts and AI scores the article low.  I want to be able to enter a message back to AI to advise what I know and ask it to try again.

I believe we could build a new function similar to evaluate_article_with_ai to be a discussion with AI.  We would need to ensure the message history is maintained during an article review session, but cleared when a new article is requested for evaluation.
